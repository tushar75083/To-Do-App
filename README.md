# To-Do-App
Welcome to the To-Do App Project! This repository contains the code for a simple and efficient To-Do application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The To-Do App Project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. This project enhanced my front-end development skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features :
1) Task Management: Add,delete tasks easily.
2) Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed to keep track of your progress.
3) Attractive Styling: Utilizes CSS to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
4) Local Storage: Saves tasks in the browser's local storage, so your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
